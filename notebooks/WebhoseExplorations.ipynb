Story highlights Carson says he knows he shouldn\\'t mention slavery but does The former neurosurgeon opposes abortion in nearly all cases (CNN) Ben Carson on Sunday compared abortion to slavery, saying he\\'d like to see the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade overturned so that the practice can be made illegal. \"Think about this. During slavery -- and I know that\\'s one of those words you\\'re not supposed to say, but I\\'m saying it -- during slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do,\" Carson said on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, \\'I don\\'t believe in slavery. I think it\\'s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do?\\'\" he added. \"Where would we be?\" Carson said he opposes abortion in nearly all instances -- including in pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. Read More NBC host Chuck Todd asked Carson, \"Whose right, I guess, should be superseded? The mother or the unborn child? Whose right, who has greater rights?\" Carson responded, \"In the ideal situation, the mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate the baby. You know, things are set up in such a way that the person in the world who has the greatest interest in protecting the baby is the mother. We\\'ve allowed the purveyors of the vision to make mothers think that that baby is their enemy and that they have a right to kill it. Can you see how perverted that line of thinking is?\"'"

       "' Just Energy Foundation\\nHOUSTON , Oct. 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- As a proud sponsor of the recent Energy Day Festival , the Just Energy Foundation was honored to present a financial award in support of the SeaPerch Challenge , an innovative underwater robotics competition that equips teachers and students with the resources they need to build an underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Presented by Deb Merril and James Lewis , Co-CEOs at Just Energy, the award went to top-placing students for their achievements in robotics, engineering, science, and mathematics (STEM) while building an underwater ROV as part of a science and engineering technology curriculum.\\nSeaPerch began as one project in a book entitled \"How to Build an Underwater Robot,\" by Harry Bohm and Vickie Jensen . Years later, MIT Professor, Thomas Consi , developed a curriculum around SeaPerch as a way to grow the Ocean Engineering Program at MIT . The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME) then had the vision to manage the program and partner with ONR to take the SeaPerch Program from what was essentially a teacher-training program and develop it into a national program. Today, the SeaPerch Program is managed by the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation (AUVSIF). Expansion continues with well over 100,000 students participating in the SeaPerch program and over 6,000 mentors working with students.\\n\"We\\'re absolutely honored to support educational events and activities like the SeaPerch Challenge to help youth harness their vast potential,\" said Deb Merril . \"It is our privilege, through the Just Energy Foundation, to assist educational organizations dedicated to working with young people in offering innovative, inspiring and hands-on technology learning at an early age. By investing in our youth now, we invest in the future and the development of our science and energy leaders of tomorrow.\"\\n2014 Energy Day Academic Program (EDAP)\\nEDAP is presented by Consumer Energy Education Foundation, Consumer Energy Alliance, and corporate Energy Day partners. It is part of Energy Day\\'s year-long initiative to engage students in energy and STEM education. The Program helps to amplify existing academic competitions and events through a series of seven unique, citywide, energy-related competitions aimed to motivate, challenge and inspire young minds to seek careers in science and technology. Winning students were recognized at the SEFH Awards Ceremony in February, as well as receiving recognition and an invitation to display their projects at Energy Day in October.\\nAbout Just Energy Foundation\\nThe Just Energy Foundation was established in 2013 by Just Energy Group Inc. to help registered Canadian and U.S. charitable organizations secure the resources required to promote the health and well-being of communities in need. Funded entirely by Just Energy, the Foundation invests in local programs that work to enhance the quality of life in Just Energy\\'s operating markets towards building stronger and supportive communities.\\nAbout Just Energy Group Inc.\\nEstablished in 1997, Just Energy (NYSE:JE, TSX:JE) is primarily a competitive retailer of natural gas and electricity.
